## Background

This project uses a data set provided by Lynne Passanisi on Data.World:
data.world/lynne588/walt-disney-world-ride-data

The original intention of creating this data set was to determine the best potential future ride types and locations to create at Walt Disney World.

My goal in using this data set is to create an amazing family vacation experience with my husband and 5 year old.  The below questions are just the beginning of exploration into the information provided.

## What park has the most rides?

## What park has the most rides that would be best for my son?

## What park has the most rides that fall into the 'no height restriction' category?

## What are the highest ranked rides that do not have a height restriction?


## Conclusion

## Data Limitations
Possible limitations of this data set from 2018 include:
  Rides built after 2018
  Discrepancies in Travel and Leisure/Trip Advisor ride rankings
  Data collection accuracy
    Undefined: ride vs experience
    Undefined: age of 'kids'
